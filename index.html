    <p>The institution was conceived in 1929 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_Aldrich_Rockefeller">Abby Aldrich Rockefeller</a>, Lillie P. Bliss, and Mary Quinn Sullivan. From the 1930s through the 1950s, MoMA became a host to several landmark exhibitions, including Barr's influential <a href= "https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/2748">Cubism and Abstract Art</a> in 1936. Nelson Rockefeller became the museum's president in 1939, playing a key role in its expansion and publicity. David Rockefeller joined the board in 1948 and continued the family's close association with the museum until his death in 2017. In 1953, Philip Johnson redesigned the garden, which subsequently became the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden.</p>
    <p>The museum has been instrumental in shaping the history of modern art, particularly modern art from Europe. Some of the most notable works include: The Starry Night, The Persistence of Memory, and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. In recent decades, MoMA has expanded its collection and programming to include works by traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>
    <p>In 2023, MoMA was visited by over 2.8 million people, making it the 15th most-visited art museum in the world and the 6th most-visited museum in the United States. To plan your visit, please see our <a href=#section>gallery map.</a></p>
